  abstract = {Let (C*, {$\partial$}*) be an algebraic complex, where each Cr is a finite dimensional complex vector space. Let {$\delta$}r :Cr-1 \textrightarrow{} Cr be the adjoint of {$\partial$}r and let {$\Omega$}r :Cr \textrightarrow{} Cr be the Laplacian, {$\Omega$}r = {$\delta$}r{$\partial$}r+ {$\partial$}r+1{$\delta$}r+1. This survey discusses the result that ker {$\Omega$}r is isomorphic to Hr(C) and to Hr (C). We focus on applications of this result in instances where the complex C has a combinatorial structure. We discuss several instances in which a complete spectral resolution of the Laplacian can be achieved},

  abstract = {We present a thorough study of the theoretical properties and devise efficient algorithms for the persistent Laplacian, an extension of the standard combinatorial Laplacian to the setting of pairs (or, in more generality, sequences) of simplicial complexes \$K \textbackslash hookrightarrow L\$,  which was recently introduced by Wang, Nguyen, and Wei. In particular, in analogy with the nonpersistent case, we first prove that the nullity of the \$q\$th persistent Laplacian \$\textbackslash Delta\_q\^\{K,L\}\$ equals the \$q\$th persistent Betti number of the inclusion \$(K \textbackslash hookrightarrow L)\$. We then present an initial algorithm for finding a matrix representation of \$\textbackslash Delta\_q\^\{K,L\}\$, which itself helps interpret the persistent Laplacian.  We exhibit a novel relationship between the persistent Laplacian and the notion of Schur complement of a matrix which has several important implications. In the graph case, it both uncovers a link with the notion of effective resistance and leads to a persistent version of the Cheeger inequality. This relationship also yields an additional, very simple algorithm for finding (a matrix representation of) the \$q\$th persistent Laplacian which in turn leads to a novel and fundamentally different algorithm for computing the \$q\$th persistent Betti number for a pair \$K\textbackslash hookrightarrow L\$ which can be significantly more efficient than standard algorithms. Finally, we study persistent Laplacians for simplicial filtrations and establish novel functoriality properties and stability results for their eigenvalues. Our work brings methods from spectral graph theory, circuit theory, and persistent homology together with a topological view of the combinatorial Laplacian on simplicial complexes.},

  abstract = {Google's PageRank method was developed to evaluate the importance of web-pages via their link structure. The mathematics of PageRank, however, are entirely general and apply to any graph or network in any domain. Thus, PageRank is now regularly used in bibliometrics, social and information network analysis, and for link prediction and recommendation. It's even used for systems analysis of road networks, as well as biology, chemistry, neuroscience, and physics. We'll see the mathematics and ideas that unite these diverse applications.},
