\section{ 101 on Spectral Matrix Nearness Problems }

\todo{definition}

Generally speaking, for a given matrix \( A \) a \emph{matrix nearness problem} consists of finding the closest possible matrix \( X \) among the admissible set with a number of desired properties. For instance, one may search for the closest (in some metric) symmetric positive/negative definite matrix, unitary matrix or the closest graph Laplacian. 

Motivated by the topological meaning of the \emph{kernel} of Hodge Laplacians \( L_k \), we assume the specific case of \emph{spectral} MNPs: here one aims for the target matrix \( X \) to have a specific spectrum \( \sigma(X) \). For instance in the stability study of the dynamical system \( \dot{\b x} = A \b x \) one can search for the closest Hurwitz matrix such that \( \mathrm{Re} \left[ \lambda_i \right] < 0 \) for all \( \lambda_i \in \sigma(X) \); similarly, assuming given matrix \( A \) is a graph Laplacian, one can search for the closest disconnected graph (so the algebraic connectivity \( \lambda_2 = 0 \)).

Here we recite the optimization framework developed by REFREFREF\todo{fix it} for the class of the spectral matrix nearness problems; one should note, however, that this is by far not the only approach to the task, REFREFREF\todo{also fix it with Nicholas and others, I guess?}.

\subsection{Functional and Gradient Flow}

Let as assume that \( X = A + \Delta \) and intead of searching for \( X \), we search for the perturbation matrix \( \Delta \); additionally, we assume that \( \Omega \) is the admissible set containing all possible perturbations \( \Delta \).

\subsection{Principal spectral inheritance}


Before moving on to the next section, we recall here a relatively direct  but important spectral property that connects the spectra of the $k$-th and $(k+1)$-th order Laplacians. 

\begin{theorem}[HOL's spectral inheritance]\label{thm:inherit}
  Let $L_k$ and $L_{k+1}$ be  higher-order Laplacians for the same simplicial complex $\mc K$. Let $\bar L_k=\bar L_k^{down}+\bar L_k^{up}$, where $\bar L_k^{down}=\bar B_k^\top \bar B_k$ and $\bar L_k^{up}=\bar B_{k+1} \bar B_{k+1}^\top$. Then:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\sigma_+(\bar L_k^{up})=\sigma_+(\bar L_{k+1}^{down})$, where $\sigma_+(\cdot)$ denotes the positive part of the spectrum;
    \item if $ 0 \ne \mu \in \sigma_+(\bar L_k^{up}) = \sigma_+(\bar L_{k+1}^{down})$, then the eigenvectors are related as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item if $\b x$ is and eigenvector for $\bar L_k^{up}$ with the eigenvalue $\mu$, then $\b y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu}} \bar B_{k+1}^\top \b x$ is an eigenvector for $\bar L_{k+1}^{down}$ with the same eigenvalue;
      \item if $\b u$ is and eigenvector for $\bar L_{k+1}^{down}$ with the eigenvalue $\mu$ and $\b u \notin \ker \bar B_{k+1}$, then $\b v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu}} \bar B_{k+1} \b u$ is an eigenvector for $\bar L_{k}^{up}$ with the same eigenvalue;
    \end{enumerate}
    \item for each Laplacian $\bar L_k$: if $\b v \notin \ker \bar L_k^{down}$ is the eigenvector for $\bar L_k^{down}$, then $\b v \in \ker \bar L_{k}^{up}$; vice versa, if $\b u \notin \ker \bar L_k^{up}$ is the eigenvector for $\bar L_k^{up}$, then $\b v \in \ker \bar L_k^{down}$;
    \item consequently, there exist $\mu \in \sigma_+(\bar L_k)$ with an eigenvector $\b u \in \ker \bar L_k^{up}$, and $\nu \in \sigma_+(\bar L_{k+1})$ with an eigenvector $\b u \in \ker \bar L_{k+1}^{down}$, such that:
    $$
    \bar B_k^\top \bar B_k \b v  = \mu \b v, \qquad \bar B_{k+2} \bar B_{k+2}^\top \b u = \nu \b u\, . 
    $$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
For $(2a)$ it is sufficient to note that $ \bar L_{k+1}^{down} \b y = \bar B_{k+1}^\top \bar B_{k+1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu}} \bar B_{k+1}^\top \b x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu}}\bar B_{k+1}^\top \bar L_k^{up} \b x = \sqrt \mu \bar B_{k+1}^\top \b x  = \mu \b y$. Similarly, for $(2b)$: $\bar L_k^{up} \b v= \bar B_{k+1} \bar B_{k+1}^\top \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu}} \bar B_{k+1} \b u = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu}} \bar B_{k+1} \bar L_{k+1}^{down} \b u = \mu \b v $; joint $2(a)$ and $2(b)$ yield $(1)$. \emph{Hodge decomposition} immediately yields the strict separation of eigenvectors between $\bar L_k^{up}$ and $\bar L_k^{down}$, $(3)$; given $(3)$, all the inherited  eigenvectors from $(2a)$ fall into the $\ker \bar L_{k+1}^{down}$, thus resulting into $(4)$.
\end{proof}
In other words, the variation of the spectrum of the $k$-th Laplacian when moving from one order to the next one works as follows: 
the down-term $\bar L_{k+1}^{down}$ inherits the positive part of the spectrum from the up-term of  $\bar L_k^{up}$; the  eigenvectors corresponding to the inherited positive part of the spectrum lie in the kernel of $\bar L_{k+1}^{up}$; at the same time, the ``new'' up-term $\bar L_{k+1}^{up}$ has a new, non-inherited, part of the positive spectrum (which, in turn, lies in the kernel of the $(k+2)$-th down-term).

In particular, we notice that for $k = 0$, since $B_0=0$ and $\bar L_0=\bar L_0^{up}$, the  theorem yields $\sigma_+ (\bar L_0 ) = \sigma_+ (\bar{L_1}^{down}) \subseteq \sigma_+(\bar L_1)$. In other terms, the positive spectrum of the $\bar L_0$ is inherited by the spectrum of $\bar L_1$ and the remaining (non-inherited) part of $\sigma_+(\bar L_1)$ coincides with $\sigma_+(\bar L_1^{up})$. 
\Cref{fig:thm_spct_ill} provides an  illustration of the statement of  \Cref{thm:inherit} for $k = 0$.

    \caption{Illustration for the principal spectrum inheritance (\Cref{thm:inherit}) in case $k=0$: spectra of $\bar L_1$, $\bar {\Ld 1}$ and $\bar {\Ld 1}$ are shown. Colors signify the splitting of the spectrum, $\lambda_i>0 \in \sigma(\bar L_1)$ ; all yellow eigenvalues are inherited from $\sigma_+(\bar L_0)$; red eigenvalues belong to the non-inherited part. Dashed barrier $\mu$ signifies the penalization threshold (see the target functional in \Cref{subsec:functional}) preventing homological pollution (see \Cref{subsec:connetedness}). }
